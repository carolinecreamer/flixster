### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, particularly Giphy. I think that the "load more" functionality from Giphy was especially helpful. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have embedded a video and added a hover feature so that a movie poster moves when it is hovered over!

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

We haven't demoed our projects but from showing my project to my manager, I think it looks good!

### Open-source libraries used

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

My intern manager, Iris, and Vincent, my TA, were so helpful!
